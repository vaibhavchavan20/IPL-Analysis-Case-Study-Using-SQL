## Introduction

This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to answer insightful questions about IPL (Indian Premier League) matches and player performances from 2008 to 2024. The dataset used for this case study consists of two CSV files:
- **Matches Data**: Information about every match, including teams, venue, result, and other match-related details.
- **Deliveries Data**: Ball-by-ball data for each match, including details about the runs, wickets, and other actions in each delivery.

These SQL queries have been crafted to explore key cricket statistics, including team performances, player consistency, and other insights that are commonly discussed by cricket enthusiasts.

## Purpose

The main objective of this case study is to:
- Understand how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
- Solve real-world analytical questions related to IPL matches and player performances.
- Demonstrate SQL techniques, including **JOINs**, **Window Functions**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, and **Ranking Functions**.

## Dataset

To follow along with the SQL queries, you can download or connect to the IPL datasets (`matches` and `deliveries`) which include match data from 2008 to 2024.

## How to Use

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the provided SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment. ( I have used MySQL)
- Run the queries on the IPL dataset to generate insights.
- Feel free to adapt the queries to your specific needs or explore additional questions based on the data.

## Contributing

Contributions to the case study are welcome! If you have additional questions or insights related to the dataset, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
